### Hi there 👋 I'm **DreTaX**, mainly interested in reverse engineering.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various kernel projects, researching bypasses, and anti-cheat methods.
- 💻 In the past, and present I used to, and still maintain various projects like modding platforms, which could enchance games.
- 👯 I’m also highly interested in game development, anything UnityEngine, or Unreal Engine related. I'm heavily well experienced with mono.
- 📁 I have experience in creating, and covering most parts with a usermode anti-cheat in a UnityEngine game environment.
- 📫 You may reach out to me via email, which you can find near by profile description.
- ⚡ I make useful videos for GuidedHacking.com, and plan to release further anti-cheat bypasses, or techniques there. Feel free to visit!
