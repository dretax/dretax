### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm **DreTaX**, mainly interested in reverse engineering.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various kernel projects, researching bypasses, and anti-cheat methods.
- ğŸ’» In the past, and present I used to, and still maintain various projects like modding platforms, which could enchance games.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m also highly interested in game development, anything UnityEngine, or Unreal Engine related.
- ğŸ“« You may reach out to me via email, which you can find near by profile description.
- âš¡ I make useful videos for GuidedHacking.com, and plan to release further anti-cheat bypasses, or techniques there. Feel free to visit!
